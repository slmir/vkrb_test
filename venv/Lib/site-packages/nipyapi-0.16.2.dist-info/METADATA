Features
--------

**Three layers of Python support for working with Apache NiFi:**
 - High-level Demos and example scripts
 - Mid-level Client SDK for typical complex tasks
 - Low-level Client SDKs for the full API implementation of NiFi and selected sub-projects

**Functionality Highlights:**
 - Detailed documentation of the full SDK at all levels
 - CRUD wrappers for common task areas like Processor Groups, Processors, Templates, Registry Clients, Registry Buckets, Registry Flows, etc.
 - Convenience functions for inventory tasks, such as recursively retrieving the entire canvas, or a flat list of all Process Groups
 - Support for scheduling and purging flows, controller services, and connections
 - Support for fetching and updating Variable Registries
 - Support for import/export of Versioned Flows from NiFi-Registry
 - Docker Compose configurations for testing and deployment
 - A scripted deployment of an interactive environment, and a secured configuration, for testing and demonstration purposes


Please see the `issue <https://github.com/Chaffelson/nipyapi/issues>`_ register for more information on current development.

Quick Start
-----------

| There are several scripts to produce demo environments in *nipyapi.demo.**
| The mid-level functionality is in *nipyapi.canvas / nipyapi.security / nipyapi.templates / nipyapi.versioning*
| You can access the entire API using the low-level SDKs in *nipyapi.nifi / nipyapi.registry*

The easiest way to install NiPyApi is with pip::

    # in bash
    pip install nipyapi

You can set the config for your endpoints in the central config file::

    # in python
    import nipyapi
    nipyapi.config.nifi_config.host = 'http://localhost:8080/nifi-api'
    nipyapi.config.registry_config.host = 'http://localhost:18080/nifi-registry-api'

Then import a module and execute tasks::


    nipyapi.canvas.get_root_pg_id()
    >'4d5dcf9a-015e-1000-097e-e505ed0f7fd2'

You can use the Docker demos to create a secured interactive console showing many features::

    from nipyapi.demo.secured_console import *
    from nipyapi.demo.console import *

You can also explore the scripts to get ideas for how NiPyAPi can be used to automate your environment.

Please check out the `Contribution Guide <https://github.com/Chaffelson/nipyapi/blob/master/docs/contributing.rst>`_ if you are interested in contributing to the feature set.

Background and Documentation
----------------------------

| For more information on Apache NiFi, please visit `https://nifi.apache.org <https://nifi.apache.org>`_
| For Documentation on this package please visit `https://nipyapi.readthedocs.io. <https://nipyapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_


NiFi Version Support
--------------------

| Currently we are testing against NiFi versions 1.1.2 - 1.10, and NiFi-Registry versions 0.1.0 - 0.5.0.
| If you find a version compatibility problem please raise an `issue <https://github.com/Chaffelson/nipyapi/issues>`_

Python Requirements
-------------------

| Python 2.7 or 3.5-7 supported, though other versions may work. *We will shortly stop supporting Python2*
| Tested on AL2 and OSX 10.14.x - Windows automated testing not attempted
| Outside of the standard Python modules, we make use of lxml, DeepDiff, ruamel.yaml and xmltodict in processing, and Docker for demo/tests.

-------------------

| BugFix for Issue #66 in security/get_access_policy_for_resource where NiFi Api is not expecting a resource_id to be submitted

0.10.1 (2018-08-21)
-------------------

| Minor bugfix for versioning/deploy_flow_version where version number should be a str instead of int


0.10.0 (2018-08-03)
-------------------

| Updated NiFi client for 1.7.1 release
| Updated NiFi-Registry client for 0.2.0 release

**Key Changes**

* Reworked NiFi-Registry pytest setup to support multiple versions
* Changed schedule_processor to use component. rather than status. tests as they are more reliable
* Swtiched Docker configs to use explicit versions instead of latest for more consistent behavior across environents

**Version Changes**

* Deprecated testing against NiFi-1.5.0 due to host headers issue - recommend users to upgrade to at least NiFi-1.6.0
* Deprecated testing against NiFi-1.4.0 as superfluous
* Added testing for NiFi-1.7.1 and NiFi-Registry-0.2.0


0.9.1 (2018-05-18)
------------------

| Updated Demos for 0.9 release

**New Features**

* Added a new demo for Flow Development LifeCycle which illustrates the steps a user might automate to promote Versioned Flows between NiFi environments
* Check out nipyapi.demo.fdlc to see more details

0.9.0 (2018-05-16)
------------------

| Updated NiFi client to 1.6.0 release

**Potentially Breaking Changes**

*Users should check the updated documentation and ensure their tests pass as expected*

* Several NiFi client API calls were inconsistently CamelCase'd and have been renamed in the upstream NiFi release, I have honoured those changes in this release. If you use them please check your function names if you get an error

**New Features**

* Added functionality to Deploy a versioned flow to the canvas. This was an oversight from the 0.8.0 release. Function is creatively named ./versioning/deploy_flow_version

**Other Notes**

* Updated the Issue Template to also ask how urgent the problem is so we can priortise work
* Where possible we have switched to using the Apache maintained Docker containers rather than our own, there should be no impact to this unless you were relying on some edge part of our test compose files


0.8.0 (2018-03-06)
------------------

| Introducing Secured environment support, vastly expanded Versioning support including import/export.
| Fixed Templates, better documentation, more demos, and NiFi version backtesting.

**Potentially Breaking Changes**

*Users should check the updated documentation and ensure their tests pass as expected*

* Import/Export of Flow Versions was reworked significantly and renamed to correct bugs and remove coding complications and be generally more obvious in its behavior
* Template upload/download reworked significantly to remove direct reliance on requests and correct bugs in some environments
* Reworked many list/get functions to be more standardised as we stabilise the approaches to certain tasks. This should not change again in future
* Standardised bad user submission on AssertionError, bad API submission errors on ValueError, and general API errors on ApiException. This standard should flow forwards
* Switched ruamel.yaml from >15 to <15 as advised in the project documentation, as >15 is not considered production ready

**Known Issues**

* Python2 environments with older versions of openssl may run into errors like 'SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE' when working in secured environments. This is not a NiPyApi bug, it's a problem with py2/openssl which is fixed by either upgrading openssl or moving to Python3 like you know you should

**New Features**

* Added support for working with secured NiFi environments, contributed by KevDoran
    * Added demo compatibility between secured_connection and console to produce a rich secured and version-controlled demo environment
    * Added many secured environment convenience functions to security.py
    * Integrated tokenAuth support throughout the low-level clients
* Added simple Docker deployment support in utils module for test, demo, and development
* Standardised all documentation on more readable docstrings and rst templates across the entire codebase
* Significantly expanded versioning support, users should consult the refreshed documentation
* Added experimental support for cleaning queues, process_groups, and setting scheduling of various components
* Many calls now have an auto-refresh before action option to simplify applying changes
* Implemented short and long wait controls for relevant functions to allow more deterministic changes
* Implemented generic object-list-filtering-for-a-string-in-a-field for many response get/list types
* Standardised many responses to conform to a common response contract: None for none, object for single, and list-of-objects for many
* Implemented import/export to json/yaml in versioning
* Added regression/backtesting for many functions going back through major release versions to NiFi-1.1.2. More details will be obvious from reading tests/conftest.py
* Test suites now more reliably clean up after themselves when executed on long-running environments
* Apparently logging is popular, so standard Python logging is now included

**Other notes**

* Various low-level SDK bugfixes corrected in the swagger spec and updated in the provided client
* Enhanced Template and Flow Versioning to handle significantly more complex flows
* Significantly enhanced testing fixtures
* Refactored several common functions to utils.py, and moved several common configurations to config.py
* versioning.get_flow will now export the raw Registry object for convenience when serialising flows
